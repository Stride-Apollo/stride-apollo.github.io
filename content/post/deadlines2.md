Time for another update. Here you can find a summary of our deadlines:

<!--more-->

1. Population Generator 3.a:
	- A working version is available. 
	- Not all requirements are met at the moment.
	- The performance of the generator is very bad and will need further inspection.
	- Current tests are successful
2. HDF5 implementation and tests 1.d: OK.
3. MR shared memory 4.b: This was a lot harder than we foresaw. We didn't make much progress.

Due to missed deadlines, we'll have to adjust our planning.
